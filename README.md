# Random-AI-projects. Right-now-it-sucks-but-they-will-get-more-advanced/useful-as-time-goes-on
This is just for me to see my growth rate in how quickly I can learn AI by myself (like no courses, just getting my hands dirty on real projects), and also maybe for other people to see if they are interested to see how quickly one can learn by creating actual AIs without any university degrees)

I'm am starting from literally nothing, I've just heard about gradient descent.
